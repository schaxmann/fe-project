# No News React Frontend

A React news website frontend created to pair with my REST API backend which you can find [here](https://github.com/schaxmann/my-RESTful-API).

## Frontend hosted [here](https://schaxmann-no-news.netlify.app).

The site provides functionality to browse, vote and comment on articles which are fetched from and stored in the Postgres database backend.
